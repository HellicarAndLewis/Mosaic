# Mosaic

The Mosaic project combines all the elements of the other projects.
It uses the following projects:

 - gfx: for some GL wrappers, 
 - featurex: to perform the feature extractor and matching
 - video: to receive and decode the RTMP video stream that is used as input for the mosaic (optional)
 - grid: renders some sliding images
